<h1>Report</h1>
<h2>Approach/Methodology</h2>
<p>The Idea behind the website was to creat a simple chess website where two players can 
    compete against each other via the internet.
    <br>
    To achieve this I scoured the internet looking for any librarys or frameworks that might make this process
    a little easier.
    <br>
    I am very familar with web development so I wasnt to intimidated by making a project this large by myself,
    but I used heavy use of Youtube tutorials and other online resources anytime I struggled to figure out
    what to do next.
    <br>
    As far as the methodology I cobbled together the project by attaining little milestones one at a time,
    for example creating the game board, loading in pieces, encorportating a library to handle movement,
    etc... 
    <br>
    For a brief account of the major steps of the project it was 
    <ol>
        <li>1. Setup the React enviornment and all of the libraries I planned to use (easier said than done) </li>
        <li>2. Create a local chess game</li>
        <li>3. Add Firebase functionality and make the game playable online and add the simple matchmaking/sharing</li>
        <li>4. Style it and add the report</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
<h2> Tools/Libraries/Frameworks Used </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Chess.js</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Firebase</li>
    <li>Firestore</li>
    <li>React-DND</li>
    <li>Webpack</li>
    <li>RXFire</li>
    <li>RXJS</li>
    <li>BulmaCSS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>I am pretty happy with how the app came out. The points where it lets me down is a lack of features
    I would love to encourporate a better matchmaking system, Actual User Account, In Game Point Tracking,
    among other features. That being said I believe that this project goes far beyond the expectations of
    what was assigned, so in that context, I am very satisfied with it.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Overall creating this app was a great learning experience for me because I have only finished one other 
    React project (The scale of these projects always gets away from me so I have abandoned several) and
    I learned a lot about how to work with the framework.
    <br>
    I also taught myself Bulma CSS for this project because I heard it was a cool CSS framework and I really 
    love how easy it is to make things look really slick with it, but I still do struggle with some of its 
    functionality.
    <br>
    One thing that I originally wanted to add was a chat feature, which I was able to build for the most part,
    but it didn't work very well and I struggled with displaying it at the same time as the game, so I cut the
    feature sadly, I believe I have left almost all of the code in an unreachable section of this project in case
    I want to come back to it at a future date.

    <h2>Conculsion</h2>
    <p>In conculsion, I have successfully made RC Chess a fully function webapp where you can play your
        friends in a game of chess, using all of the possible moves and tactics that the game has. Their
        are certainly features I am still working on and would like to add, but the project is a triumphant
        success
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>As mentioned a couple of times above, their are a ton of features that I have been trying to add to
        this project including a chat feature, move tracker, point scoring, among many other things that 
        had to be cut for the sake of time for this due date. I will continue to chip away at those.
